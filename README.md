# Gradient-Descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm which is commonly-used to train machine learning models and neural networks.
In this project I:

1. Coded Gradient Descent for N features and came up with predictions.

2. Applied inbuilt gradient descent available in sklearn to predict predictions.

3. Tried and tested with various combinations of learning rates and number of iterations.

4. Tried using Feature Scaling, and see if it helped in getting better results.

**Gradient Descent - 1**

Applied gradient descent on Boston dataset which contains Boston house prices.
Predictons were saved in csv file and the score was predicted.

**Gradient Descent - 2**

Applied gradient descent on Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset which contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011).

Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.
